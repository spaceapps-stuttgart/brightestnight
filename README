This is a brief proof of concept of NASAs Space Apps Challenge 'brightest night'
http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/brightest-night/

We are using a Logitech c920 for gathering images. The firmware on the camera itself is unmodified.
We are currently using quvcview to get a camera snapshot, sadly we can't provide an automatic procedure.

We use some pretty custom settings in it, howsoever we disable autofocus and any other kind of automatic features. 
The camera output is BGR3, 5/1fps, RAW image format and a resolution of 1920*1080 (aka. 1080p) howsoever the output has a resolution of 1280*720(aka. 720p).

The main.py script iterates over the raw file and calculates an average RGB Value for the whole picture.
